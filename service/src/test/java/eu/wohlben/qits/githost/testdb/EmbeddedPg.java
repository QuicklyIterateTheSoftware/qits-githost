/**
 * One real PostgreSQL for this module's whole surefire JVM.
 *
 * <p><b>Why not a container.</b> The rule that shapes everything here is that a clone of this repo
 * alone builds and tests green — no monorepo, no credentials and <em>no docker</em> — and both
 * stores this deployable boots are postgres. Testcontainers and Quarkus dev services are therefore
 * both out, while the lineages still have to be exercised against the engine they ship on. Zonky
 * resolves real postgres binaries as ordinary Maven artifacts and this class spawns them as a child
 * process: a dependency, not a daemon.
 *
 * <p><b>The instance is tracked in a system property, not in this static field alone.</b> A Quarkus
 * test run loads config sources in more than one classloader, so a second copy of this class is
 * loaded with its own statics; the property is the one thing they share, and it is what keeps the
 * count at one postgres per JVM instead of one per classloader.
 *
 * <p>A copy of the class qits-ci and qits-platform-mirror carry, because a test class is not a
 * dependency anything else can declare. What must never be shared is the DATABASE NAME: every
 * (module, datasource) pair names its own, so two surefire JVMs on one host cannot mean the same
 * database. See {@link EmbeddedPgConfigSource}.
